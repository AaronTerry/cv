  <p>I am currently studying to become a professional web developer to help build a well thought out comprehensive fuctioning website for my wife's business with book keeping.
    I also am the youth president at my local church. I got started in IT at the age of 12 when I rebuilt my father's old laptop in order to play computer games. Although I grew up facinated with learning technology I still have a lot to learn.
    I am very excited to learn web development to assist my wife and possibly go into business for myself. </p>
